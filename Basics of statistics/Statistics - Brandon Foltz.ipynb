    "## Random Variable\n",
    "A random variable is a variable that takes on numerical values as a result of random experiment or measurement.\n",
    "Associates a numerical value with each possible outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. The random variable\n",
    "2. Possible outcome the random variable can take\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Vs Continuous Random Variable\n",
    "- Discrete random variable has finite number of values or infinite sequence of values (0,1,2,....) and the differences in the outcome are meaningful. \n",
    "Example: Die throw can have a possible of 6 values 1,2,3,4,5,6\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous random variable has infinite number of outcomes that cannot be easily counted and the differences between outcome are not meaningful.\n",
    "Example: With average income difference between $40000.00 and $40000.99 is not meaningful\n",

    "## Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "Possible outcome for flip coint = 2\n",
    "Possible outcome for die = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "1. Constituting of separate (distinct) thing.\n",
    "2. Consisting of unconnected distinct parts\n",
    "3. Mathematics defined for a finite or countable set of values; not continuous.\n",

    "# Discrete Probability Distribution\n",
    "Probability Distribution is a total listing of various values the random variable can take along with corresponding probability for each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distribution for random variable describes how probabilities are assigned to each outcome of random variable.\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGM51WaHzNw&list=PLRUSZBUQY2FnkBLgUPAGUK-FZbK0h0VTz&index=4\n",
    "Probability cannot be less than 0 and greater than 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum of all RV probabilities will be 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compound Probability\n",
    "Probability of rolling a 2 or 5 during a die roll?\n",
    "(1/6)+(1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3\n",

    "# Discrete Random Variable Variance\n",
    "Though the expected value tells us the mean of random variable, oftentimes we need to know the variability, or how spread out the random variable is from the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and SD can be used to learn how dispersed random variable is dispersed from the mean\n",
    "Var(x) = σ^2 = €(χ - μ)Ρ(χ)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate expected value of ( the mean μ)\n",
    "2. Take the random variable and subtract the mean (X - μ)\n",
    "3. Square the difference\n",
    "4. Multiply with the probability of random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "sqrt(Var(x)) = σ = sqrt(€(χ - μ)Ρ(χ))\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic concepts of Expected Value\n",
    "Expected value is just the mean of a random variable. It does not have to be a value, the discrete random variable can assume.\n",
    "\n",
    "E(X) = μ = €xP(x)\n",
    "E(X) -> expected value, μ -> mean , €xP(x) -> sum of each random variable x multiplied by probability of x\n",

    "## Measures of Variability\n",
    "Consider 2 classes with scores and their mean as\n",
    "Class 1# 85 95 80 75 90, mean 85\n",
    "Class 2# 88 79 91 85 82, mean 85\n",
    "\n",
    "Both class have same mean but data points are different.\n",
    "Both have the same mean, but class 1 has more variability ( scores are more spread out )\n",
    "Class 1 has highest score 95 class 2 has 91\n",
    "Class 1 has lowest score 75 class 2 has 79\n",
    "Same mean but many variation\n",
    "\n",
    "How far is the data point from the mean? (Distance)\n",
    "SD and variance helps to answer these questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean, variation and SD are usefult when comparing a dataset or comparing against a therotical value\n",
    "σ^2 = €(x - xbar)/(n-1)\n",
    "σ = sqrt(σ^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "σ for class 1 is 7.90\n",
    "σ for class 2 is 4.74\n",
    "Data points for class 2 is close to the mean\n",
    "Data points for class 1 is bit spread out\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coefficient of variation\n",
    "CV = (SD/Mean * 100) %\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the relative measure of variability\n",
    "It measures SD relative to the mean ( % of mean related to SD )\n",
    "CV for class 1 = 9.29%\n",
    "CV for class 2 = 5.58%\n",

    "# Binomial Distribution\n",
    "Unlike the other probability outcome (example die roll which has 6 outcomes ) binomial distribution has only 2 outcomes, either a success or a failure\n",
    "Binomial experiment has following characteristics\n",
    "1. The process consists of sequence of n trials\n",
    "2. Only two exclusive outcomes in each trial -> success/failure\n",
    "3. Probability of success (p) does not change from trial to trial. Probability of failiure is 1-p and is also fixed from trial to trial.\n",
    "4. The trials are independent. The outcome of previous trials are independent of next trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n",
    "n -> number of trials\n",
    "x -> numbe4r of success\n",

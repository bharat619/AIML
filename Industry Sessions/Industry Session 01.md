Artificial Intelligence:
Theory and development of computer systems and machines with ability to perform tasks with human intelligance

Human inteliigence constitutes of
1. *Precive* the world, detect signals and collect data
2. *Inference* make sense of the world using data
3. *Decide* on course of action
4. *Act* in the real world

Techniques in enterprise
- Perception -> Collectd data/signals -> (Small / big data?, knowledge representation, deep learning)

- Inference -> Making sense of the world -> (Data analysys, statistic analysis, machine and deep learning)

- Decision -> Deciding on a course of action -> (optimisation, search, markov decision making process, reinforcement learning, game theory, simulations)

- Action -> act in real world -> (robotics, intelligence software agents)
